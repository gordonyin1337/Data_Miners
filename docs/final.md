### Project Summary:
The goal of our project is to classify Minecraft biomes using a Convolutional Neural Network and screenshots of the game as training and input data. This is a computer vision and image classification project that is not only able to print out the biome a Malmo agent is spawned in, but also compares a baseline SVM classification algorithm to a more advanced Convolutional Neural Network.
